\defclass{Randomization}

Each type of \emph{randomization} that can be applied to a general 
point set should be defined in a class that implements this interface.

\pierre{Specific subclasses have yet to be defined and implemented.
        It is still unclear if we need this in addition to container
        classes that also apply general types of randomizations.}
\hrichard{Nous n'avons jamais utilis\'e cette vieille interface. R\'ecemment,
Adam a cr\'e\'e la nouvelle interface \texttt{PointSetRandomization}.}
\richard{See the new interface \texttt{PointSetRandomization}.}
